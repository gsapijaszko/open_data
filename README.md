## Open Data sources and how to deal with it

Open Data is powerful concept that embodies freedom. Freedom of choice, access to information, and, after processing --- the attainment of knowledge. It grants us the ability to gain insights into the world around us and understand the processes occurring within it. The accessibility of data also signifies the capacity to discover connections between disparate pieces of information and seamlessly integrate them.

These few chapters aim to illustrate the availability and possibilities of working with open data, particularly focusing on spatial data.
