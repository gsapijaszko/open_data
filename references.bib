In this study we conduct an exploratory analysis of data from the OpenStreetMap initiative. Using the Corine Land Cover database as reference and continental Portugal as the study area, we establish a possible correspondence between both classification nomenclatures, evaluate the quality of OpenStreetMap polygon features classification against Corine Land Cover classes from level 1 nomenclature, and analyze the spatial distribution of OpenStreetMap classes over continental Portugal. A global classification accuracy around 76\% and interesting coverage areas' values are remarkable and promising results that encourages us for future research on this topic.},

Through the research that has been conducted recently, it has become clear that this huge amount of information might hide interesting and rich geographical information. The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project is one of the most well-known and studied VGI initiatives. It has been studied to identify its potential for different applications. In the field of Land Use/Cover, an earlier study by the authors explored the use of OSM for Land Use/Cover (LULC) validation. Using the COoRdination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC) database as the Land Use reference data, they analyzed the OSM coverage and classification accuracy, finding an interesting global accuracy value of 76.7 \% for level 1 land classes, for the study area of continental Portugal, despite a very small coverage value of approximately 3.27 \%. In this chapter we review the existing literature on using OSM data for LULC database production and move this research forwards by exploring the suitability of the OSM Points of Interest dataset. We conclude that OSM can give very interesting contributions and that the OSM Points of Interest dataset is suitable for those classified as CLC class 1 which represents artificial surfaces.},

  abstract = {OpenStreetMap offers manifold possibilities for spatial analysis and location based services. However, fitness for purpose is a commonly discussed issue. As external datasets of high quality are frequently missing, many assessments rely on intrinsic methods. Existing tools for intrinsic data analysis tend to focus on specific topics and/or regions. We present a tool that provides access to currently 32 attributes or indicators at the level of single OpenStreetMap objects. These indicators cover aspects concerning the element itself, surrounding objects and the editors of the object. The usability of the tool was proven on the use case of land-use and land-cover polygons. We applied the tool to 1000 randomly sampled polygons. A tendency that OpenStreetMap objects in more densely populated areas were smaller was detected. Age and size of the objects differed across the continents with older and smaller objects in Europe and North America. A k-means cluster analysis was used to identify groups in the data. This detected a cluster highly influenced by North American lakes that originate from imports. The tool offers amble opportunities for future research, supports the OpenStreetMap community by making informed planning decisions for future activities and enables data consumers to make informed decisions on data usage. While the development was made with land-use and land-cover information in mind, the tool can be seamlessly applied to any polygonal OpenStreetMap data and also supports linear and point data.},

Data gaps in the global OLC map were filled for a case study in Heidelberg, Germany using free remote sensing data, which resulted in a land cover (LC) prototype with complete coverage in this area. Sixty tags in the OSM were used to allocate a Corine Land Cover (CLC) level 2 land use classification to 91.8\% of the study area, and the remaining gaps were filled with remote sensing data. For this case study, complete are coverage OLC overall accuracy was estimated 87\%, which performed better than the CLC product (81\% overall accuracy) of 2012. Spatial thematic overlap for the two products was 84\%. OLC was in large parts found to be more detailed than CLC, particularly when LC patterns were heterogeneous, and outperformed CLC in the classification of 12 of the 14 classes. Our OLC product represented data created in different periods; 53\% of the area was 2011–2016, and 46\% of the area was representative of 2016–2017.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed ‘Volunteered Geographical Information’ (VGI) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80\% overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29\% of the area of England, of which approximately 24\% are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

This paper describes an implemented methodology to compare OSM street data with those of Navteq for all populated roads in Germany. As a unique feature, the presented methodology is based on a matching between the street objects of OSM and Navteq and all steps are fully automated so that they can be applied to updated versions of both data sets.While there are considerable qualitative differences between regions, towns, and street categories, at a national level the relative completeness of objects, their relative precision, and the relative completeness of names are high enough for maps. However, other attributes, which are needed for the computation of catchment areas, are still relatively incomplete.},

  abstract = {The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project is a prime example in the field of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Worldwide, several hundred thousand people are currently contributing information to the “free” geodatabase. However, the data contributions show a geographically heterogeneous pattern around the globe. Germany counts as one of the most active countries in OSM; thus, the German street network has undergone an extensive development in recent years. The question that remains is this: How does the street network perform in a relative comparison with a commercial dataset? By means of a variety of studies, we show that the difference between the OSM street network for car navigation in Germany and a comparable proprietary dataset was only 9\% in June 2011. The results of our analysis regarding the entire street network showed that OSM even exceeds the information provided by the proprietary dataset by 27\%. Further analyses show on what scale errors can be reckoned with in the topology of the street network, and the completeness of turn restrictions and street name information. In addition to the analyses conducted over the past few years, projections have additionally been made about the point in time by which the OSM dataset for Germany can be considered “complete” in relative comparison to a commercial dataset.},

  abstract = {The concept of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has recently emerged from the new Web 2.0 technologies. The OpenStreetMap project is currently the most significant example of a system based on VGI. It aims at producing free vector geographic databases using contributions from Internet users. Spatial data quality becomes a key consideration in this context of freely downloadable geographic databases. This article studies the quality of French OpenStreetMap data. It extends the work of Haklay to France, provides a larger set of spatial data quality element assessments (i.e. geometric, attribute, semantic and temporal accuracy, logical consistency, completeness, lineage, and usage), and uses different methods of quality control. The outcome of the study raises questions such as the heterogeneity of processes, scales of production, and the compliance to standardized and accepted specifications. In order to improve data quality, a balance has to be struck between the contributors' freedom and their respect of specifications. The development of appropriate solutions to provide this balance is an important research issue in the domain of user‐generated content.},
