In this study we conduct an exploratory analysis of data from the OpenStreetMap initiative. Using the Corine Land Cover database as reference and continental Portugal as the study area, we establish a possible correspondence between both classification nomenclatures, evaluate the quality of OpenStreetMap polygon features classification against Corine Land Cover classes from level 1 nomenclature, and analyze the spatial distribution of OpenStreetMap classes over continental Portugal. A global classification accuracy around 76\% and interesting coverage areas' values are remarkable and promising results that encourages us for future research on this topic.},

Through the research that has been conducted recently, it has become clear that this huge amount of information might hide interesting and rich geographical information. The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project is one of the most well-known and studied VGI initiatives. It has been studied to identify its potential for different applications. In the field of Land Use/Cover, an earlier study by the authors explored the use of OSM for Land Use/Cover (LULC) validation. Using the COoRdination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC) database as the Land Use reference data, they analyzed the OSM coverage and classification accuracy, finding an interesting global accuracy value of 76.7 \% for level 1 land classes, for the study area of continental Portugal, despite a very small coverage value of approximately 3.27 \%. In this chapter we review the existing literature on using OSM data for LULC database production and move this research forwards by exploring the suitability of the OSM Points of Interest dataset. We conclude that OSM can give very interesting contributions and that the OSM Points of Interest dataset is suitable for those classified as CLC class 1 which represents artificial surfaces.},

  abstract = {OpenStreetMap offers manifold possibilities for spatial analysis and location based services. However, fitness for purpose is a commonly discussed issue. As external datasets of high quality are frequently missing, many assessments rely on intrinsic methods. Existing tools for intrinsic data analysis tend to focus on specific topics and/or regions. We present a tool that provides access to currently 32 attributes or indicators at the level of single OpenStreetMap objects. These indicators cover aspects concerning the element itself, surrounding objects and the editors of the object. The usability of the tool was proven on the use case of land-use and land-cover polygons. We applied the tool to 1000 randomly sampled polygons. A tendency that OpenStreetMap objects in more densely populated areas were smaller was detected. Age and size of the objects differed across the continents with older and smaller objects in Europe and North America. A k-means cluster analysis was used to identify groups in the data. This detected a cluster highly influenced by North American lakes that originate from imports. The tool offers amble opportunities for future research, supports the OpenStreetMap community by making informed planning decisions for future activities and enables data consumers to make informed decisions on data usage. While the development was made with land-use and land-cover information in mind, the tool can be seamlessly applied to any polygonal OpenStreetMap data and also supports linear and point data.},

Data gaps in the global OLC map were filled for a case study in Heidelberg, Germany using free remote sensing data, which resulted in a land cover (LC) prototype with complete coverage in this area. Sixty tags in the OSM were used to allocate a Corine Land Cover (CLC) level 2 land use classification to 91.8\% of the study area, and the remaining gaps were filled with remote sensing data. For this case study, complete are coverage OLC overall accuracy was estimated 87\%, which performed better than the CLC product (81\% overall accuracy) of 2012. Spatial thematic overlap for the two products was 84\%. OLC was in large parts found to be more detailed than CLC, particularly when LC patterns were heterogeneous, and outperformed CLC in the classification of 12 of the 14 classes. Our OLC product represented data created in different periods; 53\% of the area was 2011–2016, and 46\% of the area was representative of 2016–2017.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed ‘Volunteered Geographical Information’ (VGI) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80\% overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29\% of the area of England, of which approximately 24\% are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

This paper describes an implemented methodology to compare OSM street data with those of Navteq for all populated roads in Germany. As a unique feature, the presented methodology is based on a matching between the street objects of OSM and Navteq and all steps are fully automated so that they can be applied to updated versions of both data sets.While there are considerable qualitative differences between regions, towns, and street categories, at a national level the relative completeness of objects, their relative precision, and the relative completeness of names are high enough for maps. However, other attributes, which are needed for the computation of catchment areas, are still relatively incomplete.},

Worldwide, several hundred thousand people are currently contributing information to the “free” geodatabase. However, the data contributions show a geographically heterogeneous pattern around the globe. Germany counts as one of the most active countries in OSM; thus, the German street network has undergone an extensive development in recent years. The question that remains is this: How does the street network perform in a relative comparison with a commercial dataset? By means of a variety of studies, we show that the difference between the OSM street network for car navigation in Germany and a comparable proprietary dataset was only 9\% in June 2011. The results of our analysis regarding the entire street network showed that OSM even exceeds the information provided by the proprietary dataset by 27\%. Further analyses show on what scale errors can be reckoned with in the topology of the street network, and the completeness of turn restrictions and street name information. In addition to the analyses conducted over the past few years, projections have additionally been made about the point in time by which the OSM dataset for Germany can be considered “complete” in relative comparison to a commercial dataset.},

The OpenStreetMap project is currently the most significant example of a system based on VGI. It aims at producing free vector geographic databases using contributions from Internet users. Spatial data quality becomes a key consideration in this context of freely downloadable geographic databases. This article studies the quality of French OpenStreetMap data. It extends the work of Haklay to France, provides a larger set of spatial data quality element assessments (i.e. geometric, attribute, semantic and temporal accuracy, logical consistency, completeness, lineage, and usage), and uses different methods of quality control. The outcome of the study raises questions such as the heterogeneity of processes, scales of production, and the compliance to standardized and accepted specifications. In order to improve data quality, a balance has to be struck between the contributors' freedom and their respect of specifications. The development of appropriate solutions to provide this balance is an important research issue in the domain of user‐generated content.},

  abstract = {Isochrones are generally defined as the set of all space points from which a query point can be reached in a given timespan, and they are used in urban planning to conduct reachability and coverage analyzes in a city. In a spatial network representing the street network, an isochrone is represented as a subgraph of the street network. Such a network representation is not always sufficient to determine all objects within an isochrone, since objects are not only on the network but might be in the immediate vicinity of links (e.g., houses along a street). Thus, the spatial area covered by an isochrone needs to be considered. In this paper we present two algorithms for determining all objects that are within an isochrone. The main idea is to first transform an isochrone network into an isochrone area, which is then intersected with the objects. The first approach constructs a spatial buffer around each edge in the isochrone network, yielding an area that might contain holes. The second approach creates a single area that is delimited by a polygon composed of the outermost edges of the isochrone network. In an empirical evaluation using real-world data we compare the two solutions with a precise yet expensive baseline algorithm. The results demonstrate the efficiency and high accuracy of our solutions.},

One of the crucial tasks is optimization of bus stops location for purposes of public transport usability and convenience. Most of current methods of solving such problems omit various obstacles and models of pedestrian motion. The study proposes a new method, which calculates walking time from bus stops using a method of building isochrones. The method provides polygons of various forms to represent what points an individual can reach within various times. This method takes into account a model of the pedestrian motion as well as natural obstacles like rivers, buildings or roads which prevent citizens from walking directly. A new application simulates pedestrian accessibility zones for different types of pedestrians who move at different speed. The application also calculates an area of these zones and the ratio of the area of each zone and the total area of the district. The developed software was used in the city of Samara (Russia). To simulate pedestrian accessibility a city district situated on its geographical center were selected. After obtaining the results of the simulation, we analyzed geo-data and made recommendations on changing bus route number 2 by adding new bus stops. The accessibility of one of the zones has increased after the changes, so the proposed method can be used in intelligent decision support systems.},

  abstract = {The recent sustainability challenges that our world is facing have raised, more than ever, the attention to the mobility of passengers and freight in the European and international agendas. The energy transition that has begun globally requires identifying and adopting safe, resilient, and increasingly sustainable mobility solutions. In this perspective, the modal split of passengers plays an essential role. One of the main encouraged policies is to promote an efficient mass rapid transit in urban and suburban areas. More in detail, when considering rail transport, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate the role of stations from at least two points of view: i) the ease of access to the station; ii) the opportunities that can be easily reached in its surroundings, following the concept of the “15-minutes” city. These two issues should be properly addressed to guarantee the role of railway stations as an access point to the transport system and an infrastructural element that can enhance a territory. Starting from these considerations, this research proposes a GIS-based methodology able to analyse railway stations from two points of view: i) walkability, considering the main functional characteristics of the transport network, and ii) impact on the territory, by identifying the services located in an area corresponding to “15-minutes” distances using active modes. For each railway station, the main activities in a 15-minute walking isochrone can be evaluated, both considering the walking distance on the pedestrian network and taking into account the current walkability of each link based on arc characteristics. This allows to study the accessibility of railway stations based on the current pedestrian network and the potential one with ideal characteristics. The method is applied to a case study located in Sicily (Italy), in the case of some urban stations. The final scope is to design a decision-support framework useful for railway station operators and local decision-makers to support strategic decisions regarding the railway system and the planning of appropriate pedestrian transport networks to increase railway station accessibility.},

We downscaled time series of near-surface relative humidity (hurs) and cloud area fraction (clt) under the consideration of orography and wind as well as near-surface wind speed (sfcWind) using the delta-change method. Combining these grids with mechanistically downscaled information on temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, we then calculated vapor pressure deficit (vpd), surface downwelling shortwave radiation (rsds), potential evapotranspiration (pet), the climate moisture index (cmi), and site water balance (swb) at a monthly temporal and 30 arcsec spatial resolution globally from 1980 until 2018 (time-series variables). At the same spatial resolution, we further estimated climatological normals of frost change frequency (fcf), snow cover days (scd), potential net primary productivity (npp), growing degree days (gdd), and growing season characteristics for the periods 1981–2010, 2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100, considering three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP370, SSP585) and five Earth system models (projected variables). Time-series variables showed high accuracy when validated against observations from meteorological stations and when compared to alternative products. Projected variables were also highly correlated with observations, although some variables showed notable biases, e.g., snow cover days. Together, the CHELSA-BIOCLIM+ dataset presented here (https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.332, Brun et al., 2022) allows improvement to our understanding of patterns and processes that are governed by climate, including the impact of recent and future climate changes on the world's ecosystems and the associated services on societies.},

  abstract = {High-resolution information on climatic conditions is essential to many applications in environmental and ecological sciences. Here we present the CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth’s land surface areas) data of downscaled model output temperature and precipitation estimates of the ERA-Interim climatic reanalysis to a high resolution of 30\,arc\,sec. The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979–2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

  abstract = {In situ temperature measurements revealed that the position of the high-elevation treeline is associated with a minimum seasonal mean air temperature within a temperature-defined minimum season length across latitudes. Here, we build upon this experience and present the results of a global statistical analysis and a predictive model for low temperature treeline positions. We identified 376 natural treelines from satellite images across the globe, and searched for their closest climatic proxies using a climate database. The analysis included a snow and a water balance submodel to account for season length constraints by snow pack and drought. We arrive at thermal treeline criteria almost identical to those that emerged from the earlier in situ measurements: tree growth requires a minimum length of the growing season of 94~days. The model yields best fit when the season is defined as all days with a daily mean temperature {$>$}0.9~°C, and a mean of 6.4~°C across all these days. The resultant treeline model ‘TREELIM’ offers a robust estimation of potential treeline elevation based on climate data only. Error terms include imprecise treeline position in satellite images and climate approximations in mountainous terrain. The algorithm permits constraining low temperature limits of forest growth worldwide (including polar treelines) and also permits a bioclimatic stratification of mountain biota, for instance, for biodiversity assessments. As a side product, the model yields the global potentially forested area. The results support the isotherm theory for natural treeline formation. This completely independent statistical assessment of the climatic drivers of the global treeline phenomenon confirmed the results of a multi-year measurement campaign.},

It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1\&deg;\&times;0.1\&deg; grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah).

  abstract = {The water cycle of physical regions, the life of plants, animals and biocoenoses, including the epidemic carriers of diseases, the annual round of agricultural work, migrations of animals and man, even some customs of peoples and religious festivals follow a seasonal rhythm. A natural classification of climates, which amongst other things must also form the basis for an understanding of the ecological and certain aspects of the economic life on earth, should thus in consequence be based on the seasonal course of the climatic elements. This has been done in the new map of the climatic types of the world which is presented herewith. It is based on three climatic elements. 1 The seasonal course of illumination and solar radiation between the equator and the poles which corresponds to astronomic conditions varying with latitude. 2 The seasonal course of temperature which in addition depends markedly on the distribution of water and land and on altitude. 3 The seasonal distribution of precipitation or the duration of humid periods and humid seasons as mainly conditioned by the circulation of the atmosphere. The interaction of these three climatic distribution patterns in space — climatic interference — results in the seasonal climates, the basis of zonal gradation of hydrological phenomena (regimes of rivers and lakes, water cycles etc.) of the climatic zonation of soils, of the belts of vegetation and of the types of biocoenoses. The "thermic seasonal climates" in their dependence on conditions of insolation and oceanicity or continentality are demonstrated in a series of 15 thermo-isopleths diagrams which by their simultaneous indication of seasonal and diurnal changes of temperature make it possible at a glance to distinguish the climates of polar regions, temperate latitudes and the tropics, also of the respective altitudinal zones, e. g. the thermic diurnal climates of the "cold tropics". The seasonal climates of the tropics, which in contrast to the thermic seasons of higher latitudes are mainly dominated by a seasonal alternation of precipitation, were classified according to the number of humid and arid months as "hygric seasonal climates" (after W. Lauer). In the periodically humid extra-tropical climates the seasonal course of temperature as well as precipitation must be considered simultaneously. In consequence a great many types of "thermic-hygric seasonal climates" result from the combination of summer humid — winter dry, winter humid — summer dry, spring humid — winter and summer dry and permanently dry climates with the various gradations of the seasonal course of temperature. In chapter E the different types of such climates (cf. legend to the map) are explained and compared with some characteristic phenomena of the vegetation. A comprehensive exposition of the hydrological, pedological, geomorphological and ecological consequences of the various climates would necessitate an extensive treatment of the natural landscape zones of the earth; such treatment, which will also take into account the vertical zonation, is being prepared by the author as a three dimensional landscape-regional ecology of the earth.}

  abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},
